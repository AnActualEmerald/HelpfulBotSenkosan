Let us embrace the Luciferian impulse to eat of the Tree of Knowledge and dissipate our blissful and comforting delusions of old. Let us demand that individuals be judged for their concrete actions  not their fealty to arbitrary social norms and illusory categorizations. Let us reason our solutions with agnosticism in all things  holding fast only to that which is demonstrably true. Let us stand firm against any and all arbitrary authority that threatens the personal sovereignty of One or All. That which will not bend must break  and that which can be destroyed by truth should never be spared its demise. It is Done.
